I used the web version in my presentation for gifs.  
I included a pdf version in case it's useful for someone. You might need to download it to view it (View Raw -> Save in your browser)

I'm sorry for not providing a proper version (i.e. reveal.js),
I used the _wrong_ tool to make the slides. Won't be making that mistake again :-)
